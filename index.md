# **Research**

**Mobile Edge Computing:**  Edge computing is a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity to data at its source can deliver strong business benefits, including faster insights, improved response times and better bandwidth availability. 

**D2D Collaboration:** Device-to-Device (D2D) collaboration is a decentralized communication framework that enables direct interaction between nearby devices, bypassing centralized network infrastructure. This proximity-based communication can offer significant advantages, including reduced latency, enhanced data transfer speeds, and improved resource utilization. By leveraging D2D collaboration, applications can achieve faster processing times, more efficient data sharing, and better overall performance, especially in scenarios with high device density and dynamic environments.

**Air- Ground Integration:** Air-Ground integration is an interconnected framework that enables seamless communication and data exchange between airborne and ground-based systems. This integration facilitates real-time collaboration and coordination, offering substantial benefits such as enhanced situational awareness, improved operational efficiency, and timely decision-making. By bridging the gap between air and ground networks, applications can achieve more reliable and faster data transmission, optimized resource allocation, and better overall system performance, particularly in complex and dynamic environments such as disaster response and logistics management.
